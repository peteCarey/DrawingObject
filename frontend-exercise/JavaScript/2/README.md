# JavaScript Exercise - 2

We've provided the same data object here as in the first exercise.

To complete this exercise, please create a function that will sort the data object alphabetically based on the characters first names. The function should accept at least one argument to define the sort order (either `a-z` or `z-a`).

The sorted array should be logged to the console.
