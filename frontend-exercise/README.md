# Frontend Developer Interview

You have 1 day to work through the JavaScript & CSS exercises, you don't need to worry about completing them all 
just get as far as you're able to in the time alotted.

## JavaScript

Please keep your JavaScript as simple as possible, given the limited time available we're not looking for the use of 
any frameworks or build tools; vanilla JavaScript is perfect. 

Your JavaScript code should output the results to the log.

If you feel you are running out of time, feel free to skip question 3 and move onto the CSS questions!

## CSS

Assets have been provided for you in the `CSS/assets/` folder.

You are free to use whatever CSS tools you wish (SASS/LESS etc), but your final code should be fully viewable when 
opening the index.html file included in a browser.
